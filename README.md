# What is Unfuddle AS3Lib?
It's an ActionScript 3 library and sample AIR application built to work with the Unfuddle REST API. The aim is to make it possible to do everything with ActionScript 3 that you could do with the developer API, only much easier and more familiar to Flash developers.

# Main features
* ActionScript class representations of the REST API.
* Sample AIR application implementing all of the classes in the library.

# Status
